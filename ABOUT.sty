ABSTRACT 

The Library Management System is a web-based application developed to automate the day-to-day activities of a library. The main objective of this system is to maintain book records digitally and reduce manual work. The system is developed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, making it lightweight and efficient.

This system allows an administrator to log in securely and perform various operations such as adding new books, deleting books, searching books, issuing books, and returning books. The application uses LocalStorage as a database to store book information persistently without the need for a backend server.

The Library Management System improves accuracy, saves time, and ensures easy access to library records. It provides a user-friendly interface that makes managing books simple and efficient. This project is suitable for educational institutions and demonstrates the practical implementation of web technologies in real-world scenarios.

 INTRODUCTION 

Libraries play a crucial role in educational institutions by providing access to knowledge resources. Traditional library systems involve manual record keeping, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. To overcome these issues, a digital Library Management System is required.

This project aims to develop a web-based Library Management System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system automates library operations such as book management, issuing books, and returning books. It provides a secure admin login to ensure that only authorized users can manage records.

The system stores book data in the browser using LocalStorage, eliminating the need for a complex backend database. This makes the application fast, portable, and easy to deploy. The search functionality enables quick retrieval of books, while the issue and return features track book availability.

This project demonstrates core web development concepts including DOM manipulation, event handling, and client-side storage. It is designed to be simple, scalable, and suitable for small libraries or academic projects.

 OBJECTIVES

To automate library book management

To reduce manual record keeping

To provide secure admin access

To enable fast searching of books

To track issued and available books

To improve efficiency and accuracy


TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES 

HTML – Structure of the web pages

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Logic and interactivity

LocalStorage – Client-side database

VS Code – Code editor

Web Browser – Execution environment

HTML is used to design the interface, CSS enhances user experience through styling, and JavaScript handles all logic such as adding books, issuing books, and authentication. LocalStorage stores data permanently inside the browser.



METHODOLOGY 

The project follows a modular development approach. First, the user interface is created using HTML and styled using CSS. JavaScript is then used to implement core functionalities such as login validation, book management, and search operations.

The system stores book data in LocalStorage in JSON format. When the page loads, JavaScript retrieves stored data and displays it dynamically. CRUD operations are implemented to manage books efficiently.

Each action updates LocalStorage instantly, ensuring data persistence. The project is tested in different browsers to ensure reliability.
